Following [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io)

Make sure to review that I starred. (Reason: Either fully didn't understand the solution or used built-in modules or libraries to make it easier rather than solving with algorithm.)
Better if I can review every problem on NeetCode150.
If running out of time, then review starred ones.
If there's more time, review medium and hard ones first, and then easy ones.

I've done Neetcode for all till Next Greater Element I problem. 
Changed my plan: First, do NeetCode150. After finishing it, do problems I haven't solved on Neetcode All.
